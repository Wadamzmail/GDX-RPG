# GDX-RPG 
A ~~not working~~ cross-platform RPG game engine ~~(tease you)~~

# HEY!
**This project is no longer maintained**~~(The rest is up to you)~~. The current branch is the 2.0 engine (not yet developed). 1.0 engine is relatively complete except for the battle part UI & task system. You can click [here](https://github.com/dingjibang/GDX-RPG/commit/1af96d38592a9c686b65695340c449f7968e46a2) to view and build 1.0 engine.

~~At present, my energy is mainly used in [GDX-HTML](https://github.com/dingjibang/GDX-HTML), the GOAL is to **build LibGDX ui using REAL-WORLD HTML + CSS!** [Please take a look at it](https://github.com/dingjibang/GDX-HTML)!~~

# Common build faults!important( •́ .̫ •̀  )
#### 0.Gradle Version
[here are issue of gdx](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4855), you MUST USING gradle 3.3(or 2.4?), android buildToolsVersion 24. You can remove retrolambda if AndroidStudio build failed.


#### We need [RetroLambda](https://github.com/orfjackal/retrolambda) to using java8-lambda on java7 or lower, please set the environment variable JAVA8_HOME and JAVA7_HOME with your jdk7 and jdk8 directory (so you need dual java :p).
#### 1."SDK location not found ..." or other errors while gradle building .
please download "android sdk" at first. you have to download those modules:
- Android SDK Build-tools (23.0.1)
- Android 5.1.1 (API 22)
- Android Support Library (23.0.1)
- Android Support Repository (22)

maybe you have to [set "ANDROID_HOME" variable](https://www.google.com.hk/#newwindow=1&q=how+to+set+ANDROID_HOME) or [create a local.properties file on project root!](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23983221/importing-gradle-project-android-error)

#### 2.first run this game via eclipse/android studio, and got an error "Exception in thread "LWJGL Application" com.badlogic.gdx.utils.GdxRuntimeException: Couldn't load file: xxxxxxxxx"
easy, it's [eclipse solution](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22822767/new-libgdx-setup-receive-file-not-found/22833470#22833470), and here is [android studio  solution](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24879812/libgdx-project-exception-in-thread-lwjgl-application-couldnt-load-file-erro)

#### 3.oh no, there are some errors in this project!
don't worry, the game is working, those errors are my debugging.

#### 4.and more...
you can create an issue, or mail to dingjibang@qq.com.
